# SMART CLINIC
An AI-powered real-time patient queue optimization platform that dynamically schedules consultations to reduce waiting time and maximize clinic efficiency.

# 1. Problem Statement
 # Problem Title
The Waiting Room That Never Moves

# Problem Discription
Long waiting times in hospitals and clinics create frustration for patients and inefficiency for medical staff. Most clinics use a fixed first-come-first-serve system that does not adapt to:

Emergency cases

Varying consultation durations

Doctor availability changes

No-shows or cancellations

This leads to:

Overcrowded waiting rooms

Increased patient dissatisfaction

Poor resource utilization

There is a need for a smarter system that dynamically manages patient queues in real time.

 # Target Users

Private clinics

Hospitals

Diagnostic centers

Medical reception staff

Doctors managing high patient flow

Patients waiting for consultation

1.Most clinics follow static queue systems.

2.No dynamic adjustment for emergency cases.

3.Waiting time is unpredictable.
